5630,45,Yugoslavia,>10000,3,accomodation,,,,,,1997.0,"??but at the same time the daily protests remain bolstered by the country s economic collapse, which has seen salaries drop from 800 a month six years ago to less than 100 a month, widespread unemployment and endemic government corruption. there are increasing signs of discontent within the ruling structure. senior police and military officials have called for compromise and overruled hard liners who advocate using force to stop protesters from congregating daily in belgrade and several dozen other cities, western diplomats say. ?? protests began in 1996 and continued daily for 6 weeks before taking a day break, this is the resumption of those protests. ??djindjic declared the demonstrations will continue and repeated the coalition s demands for the state to relinquish its virtual monopoly on radio and television and punish those responsible for beating and jailing opposition demonstrators. his comments demonstrated anew how the protests, which started over the contested municipal elections, expanded over the weeks to include more general opposition to milosevic s government. ??"
10892,31,Algeria,100-999,3,accomodation,,,,,,2017.0,"political considerations will continue to hamper fiscal consolidation efforts in algeria, as the need to maintain social stability will prevent the government from targeting politically sensitive avenues of spending. as a result, planned spending cuts will not materialise in full, and will not offset lower for longer oil prices. a series of subsidy cuts and tax hikes announced in the 2017 budget prompted protests in cities across the country and we expect continued popular opposition to any harsh austerity measures which will hinder progress in fiscal consolidation. the government has already rolled back on planned hikes to electricity prices in the southern desert following mass demonstrations there, and in june, bouteflika announced that there would be a 2.5 rise in pensions, following a similar hike the year before."
